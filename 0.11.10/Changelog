Version: 0.10.0
Date   : 17/06/2007
Author : Ian Ventura-Whiting (Fizz)
Notes  : This release concentrates on adding a large number
         of additional features for IOS-based devices. IOS
         devices contain far more configuration options than
         all the other devices combined. Additionally, Cisco
         CSS devices have been added as another supported
         device type. Other device types will have support
         extended in upcoming versions.
Warning: The subversion repository now contains testdata.
         I would very strong advise against using those
         configurations on any devices, they are intended
         for testing purposes only. Use those configs at
         your own risk.
Changes: The following nipper features have been added or
         improved with this release. A * represents new
         features.

         General Program Features:
            > Additional appendix section addition or
              removal options.
            > Filter Source Checking *
            > Filter Deny and Log Checking *
            > Seperation of Switch and Router issues
            > Options for device usage. I.e. Internal or
              edge routing device *
            > Added command line option to specify a
              device name. It helps for configs where
              the name is not specified in the config. *
