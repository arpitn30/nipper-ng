Quick Start Guide
=================

NOTE: Tutorials are available at http://nipper.titania.co.uk

If you haven't already installed nipper, follow the procedures outlined
in the INSTALL file.

Before using nipper you will need the configuration of your network
device saved to a text file. Typically for Cisco devices the
procedure for obtaining this would be:

  1. Logon to Cisco device
  2. Enter Enable mode
  3. Type "show run"
  4. Capture the output to a file
  5. Logout

Once you have the configuration file and nipper is installed you are
ready. nipper does not (currently) automatically detect what type of
device you are about to perform an audit of, so it must be told.

For a Cisco IOS Switch with a configuration file stored in
/home/fred/switch.txt and output to an XML file the command would be:

  nipper --ios-switch --input=/home/fred/switch.txt --xml --output=audit.xml

The device types currently supported by nipper are specified using the
following command line parameters:

    CMD Option      Device Type
    =================================================
    --ios-switch    Cisco IOS-based Switch
    --ios-router    Cisco IOS-based Router (default)
    --ios-catalyst  Cisco IOS-based Catalyst
    --pix           Cisco PIX-based Firewall
    --asa           Cisco ASA-based Firewall
    --fwsm          Cisco FWSM-based Router
    --catos         Cisco CatOS-based Catalyst
    --nmp           Cisco NMP-based Catalyst
    --css           Cisco Content Services Switch
    --screenos      Juniper NetScreen Firewall
    --passport      Nortel Passport Device
    --sonicos       SonicWall SonicOS Firewall
    --fw1           CheckPoint Firewall-1 Firewall

The order in which the options are specified is irrelevent. To get a full
list of options, use the following command:
