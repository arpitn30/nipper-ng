    The Network Infrastructure Parser


nipper is a Network Infrastructure Configuration Parser. nipper takes
a network infrastructure device configuration, processes the file and
details security-related issues with the configuration together with
detailed recommendations. nipper was previous known as CiscoParse.

nipper currently supports:

   Cisco Switches (IOS)
   Cisco Routers (IOS)
   Cisco Firewalls (PIX, ASA, FWSM)
   Cisco Catalysts (NMP, CatOS, IOS)
   Cisco Content Service Switches (CSS)
   Juniper NetScreen Firewalls (ScreenOS)
   CheckPoint Firewall-1 (FW1)
   Nortel Passport Devices
   SonicWALL SonicOS Firewalls

Output from nipper is in HTML, Latex, XML and Text. Additionally, nipper
will reverse any Cisco type-7 passwords, any other encrypted passwords
can be output to a John-the-Ripper file for further testing.
By default, input is retrieved from stdin and is output (in HTML format)
to stdout.
